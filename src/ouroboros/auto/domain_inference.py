"""Ledger-derived task-class inference (L1-b of #1157 / #1171).

The Socratic interview already extracts structured `SeedDraftLedger`
entries (`actors`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `runtime_context`, …) and
*standardizes them toward canonical vocabulary* (e.g. "do you mean
stdout, stderr, or both?"). L1-b derives the task class from those
already-standardized entries by deterministic pattern matching — no
new LLM call, no eval set, no accuracy floor.

The matcher returns one of three outcomes:

- ``DomainInference.single(...)`` — exactly one class predicate fired.
- ``DomainInference.ambiguous(...)`` — multiple classes fired; the
  interview driver should ask a disambiguation question (L1-c).
- ``DomainInference.single(LIBRARY, reason="unmatched")`` — no
  predicate fired; falls to the safest default and emits a
  ``domain_unmatched`` telemetry signal so maintainers can grow the
  catalog.

Adding a new task class = adding a ``_matches_<name>`` function +
registering it in ``_PATTERN_REGISTRY`` + a unit test. ~10 LoC PR per
class, not an ML eval-set re-curation.

# Explicit-negation pattern matching common natural-language denials of
# the CLI signal. The earlier whitelist-of-connectors strategy
# (rounds 2-6) proved too narrow — every review round surfaced another
# descriptive participle that was missing from the list ("intended",
# "meant", "designed", "exposed", "for", …). Switching to a generic
# distance-bounded path with an *affirmative-qualifier blocklist* is
# both more robust and easier to reason about:
#
#   <negation cue>   <path of up to 7 tokens>   <cli|command-line>
#
# The strip is *suppressed* if the path contains an affirmative-flip
# qualifier — "just", "only", "also", "rather", "but" — because those
# tokens turn the phrase into an affirmative expansion ("not just a
# CLI", "not only a CLI", "not a webhook but rather a CLI") that
# genuinely asserts CLI. Those cases must keep their CLI signal.
#

#   - Direct:           "not a CLI", "no CLI", "never a CLI",
#                       "isn't a CLI".

#                       "shouldn't be a CLI", "doesn't have to be a CLI".
#   - Exclusion:        "without a CLI", "excluding a CLI", "sans CLI",
#                       "instead of a CLI", "rather than a CLI".
#   - Participle:       "not intended to be a CLI", "not meant to be
#                       a CLI", "not designed to be a CLI",
#                       "not exposed as a CLI", "not for CLI use".
